              FX deals with this kind of fluctuations of values of different

              sometimes, the Chinese Yuan would be nice to have.

              You're probably familiar with the idea of inflation and deflation.
              That's the change of purchasing power of your money. If you could
              buy 1 loaf of bread with a coin, and now you need 2 coins, it's
              inflation. Vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we just need to change the loafs of bread to other currencies!
              If you could buy a Mars Coin coin (currency on Mars) with $1 USD,
              and somehow now you need $2 USD for 1 Mars Coin(due to inflation),
              your USD is depreciating!

            <p>Spot FX is the most common way to trade FX.</p>
            <p>When you hear "Spot", think "the day after tomorrow", or t+2.</p>
            <p>
              What is means is, what you decided to buy/sell today, you'll pay
              for it/receive payment on the day after tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's make a spot trade. You want to buy 1M Mars Coin (The
              currency on Mars, abbreviated as MRC) on spot date. The bank says
              yes. The exchange rate of USD/MRC is 2.00. That means you'll need
              to pay $2M in USD.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, two days from today is when you'll pay for the 1M Mars Coin
              with $2M. Maybe at this point the exchange rate has changed. Maybe
              2.10 or something. But you'll pay at the exchange rate on the day
              that the trade was made.

            <p>
              Remember the swaps we played with earlier? Forward FX is usually
              done with FX swaps. Ah. Our good friend swaps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes. We're putting that onto Foreign Exchange. Ooooh things are
              getting complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              What it is, essentially, is two foreign exchange deals made at the
              same time, but settled on two different days.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, let's say you entered a swap position with a bank.
              You agreed to buy 1M Mars Coin, paid with USD, and sell the same
              amount of Mars Coins later this week.
            </p>
            <p>You might be wondering, why the heck do I want to do that?</p>
            <p>
              Well, if banks want to move settlement dates around for a deal
              that's already made, they can use these beauties! For example, a
              bank made a spot trade to buy Mars Coins that happens on Monday
              (hence settles on Wednesday), they can use a S/N (Spot-Next) swap
              to move the spot trade's settlement date to Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's because for a S/N swap, you're selling Mars Coins (the same
              amount that you were buying) on the spot date, and re-buying them
              on Thursday.
